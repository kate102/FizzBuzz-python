# FizzBuzz-python

First I wrote 'hello world', very simple.
Python seems to have a lot of similarities with Ruby so this was straight forward

I then wrote fizzBuzz, this was also fairly straightforward.
What I noticed was:
- No brackets to define scope, indentation instead
- Each method/function call needs () despite not having any arguments
- Colon after method parentheses
- String has to be explicitly returned
- Function name starts with a lowercase letter
